# Spell Portal

This is a message board on Ethereum test net Rinkeby with a little twist of my own.  You can open a portal and post a manifestation to the universe.  This is a Build Space project for learning how to develop Dapps using Solidity, Hardhat as a back-end and React as a front-end.

### Getting started


Install the  [Back-end](https://github.com/SiriusLL/my-wave-portal).

run `npm install` to install dependancies

`npm start` will open a browser at localhost:3000 as a default

This Dapp only uses Rinkeby test Eth, make sure you are on the right network, do not use real Eth you will lose it.

You need metamask to use this app you can install it [here](https://metamask.io/)
